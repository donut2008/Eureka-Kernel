h
    Path to be examined; can be string, bytes, a path-like object or
    open-file-descriptor int.
  dir_fd
    If not None, it should be a file descriptor open to a directory,
    and path should be a relative string; path will then be relative to
    that directory.
  follow_symlinks
    If False, and the last element of the path is a symbolic link,
    stat will examine the symbolic link itself instead of the file
    the link points to.

dir_fd and follow_symlinks may not be implemented
  on your platform.  If they are unavailable, using them will raise a
  NotImplementedError.

It's an error to use dir_fd or follow_symlinks when specifying path as
  an open file descriptor.          access($module, /, path, mode, *, dir_fd=None, effective_ids=False,
       follow_symlinks=True)
--

Use the real uid/gid to test for access to a path.

  path
    Path to be tested; can be string, bytes, or a path-like object.
  mode
    Operating-system mode bitfield.  Can be F_OK to test existence,
    or the inclusive-OR of R_OK, W_OK, and X_OK.
  dir_fd
    If not None, it should be a file descriptor open to a directory,
    and path should be relative; path will then be relative to that
    directory.
  effective_ids
    If True, access will use the effective uid/gid instead of
    the real uid/gid.
  follow_symlinks
    If False, and the last element of the path is a symbolic link,
    access will examine the symbolic link itself instead of the file
    the link points to.

dir_fd, effective_ids, and follow_symlinks may not be implemented
  on your platform.  If they are unavailable, using them will raise a
  NotImplementedError.

Note that most operations will use the effective uid/gid, therefore this
  routine can be used in a suid/sgid environment to test if the invoking user
  has the specified access to the path.          ttyname($module, fd, /)
--

Return the name of the terminal device connected to 'fd'.

  fd
    Integer file descriptor handle. chdir($module, /, path)
--

Change the current working directory to the specified path.

path may always be specified as a string.
On some platforms, path may also be specified as an open file descriptor.
  If this functionality is unavailable, using it raises an exception.              chmod($module, /, path, mode, *, dir_fd=None, follow_symlinks=True)
--

Change the access permissions of a file.

  path
    Path to be modified.  May always be specified as a str, bytes, or a path-like object.
    On some platforms, path may also be specified as an open file descriptor.
    If this functionality is unavailable, using it raises an exception.
  mode
    Operating-system mode bitfield.
  dir_fd
    If not None, it should be a file descriptor open to a directory,
    and path should be relative; path will then be relative to that
    directory.
  follow_symlinks
    If False, and the last element of the path is a symbolic link,
    chmod will modify the symbolic link itself instead of the file
    the link points to.

It is an error to use dir_fd or follow_symlinks when specifying path as
  an open file descriptor.
dir_fd and follow_symlinks may not be implemented on your platform.
  If they are unavailable, using them will raise a NotImplementedError.            fchmod($module, /, fd, mode)
--

Change the access permissions of the file given by file descriptor fd.

Equivalent to os.chmod(fd, mode).      chown($module, /, path, uid, gid, *, dir_fd=None, follow_symlinks=True)
--

Change the owner and group id of path to the numeric uid and gid.\

  dir_fd
    If not None, it should be a file descriptor open to a directory,
