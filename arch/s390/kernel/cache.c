 *
 * Jprobes (a.k.a. "jump probes" which is built on-top of kprobes) allow a
 * probe to be inserted into the beginning of a function call.  The fundamental
 * difference between a jprobe and a kprobe is the jprobe handler is executed
 * in the same context as the target function, while the kprobe handlers
 * are executed in interrupt context.
 *
 * For jprobes we initially gain control by placing a break point in the
 * first instruction of the targeted function.  When we catch that specific
 * break, we:
 *        * set the return address to our jprobe_inst_return() function
 *        * jump to the jprobe handler function
 *
 * Since we fixed up the return address, the jprobe handler will return to our
 * jprobe_inst_return() function, giving us control again.  At this point we
 * are back in the parents frame marker, so we do yet another call to our
 * jprobe_break() function to fix up the frame marker as it would normally
 * exist in the target function.
 *
 * Our jprobe_return function then transfers control back to kprobes.c by
 * executing a break instruction using one of our reserved numbers.  When we
 * catch that break in kprobes.c, we continue like we do for a normal kprobe
 * by single stepping the emulated instruction, and then returning execution
 * to the correct location.
