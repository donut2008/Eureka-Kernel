 *
 * This stub allows us to make EFI calls in physical mode with interrupts
 * turned off.  We need this because we can't call SetVirtualMap() until
 * the kernel has booted far enough to allow allocation of struct vma_struct
 * entries (which we would need to map stuff with memory attributes other
 * than uncached or writeback...).  Since the GetTime() service gets called
 * earlier than that, we need to be able to make physical mode EFI calls from
 * the kernel.

 * PSR settings as per SAL spec (Chapter 8 in the "IA-64 System
 * Abstraction Layer Specification", revision 2.6e).  Note that
 * psr.dfl and psr.dfh MUST be cleared, despite what this manual says.
 * Otherwise, SAL dies whenever it's trying to do an IA-32 BIOS call
 * (the br.ia instruction fails unless psr.dfl and psr.dfh are
 * cleared).  Fortunately, SAL promises not to touch the floating
 * point regs, so at least we don't have to save f2-f127.
